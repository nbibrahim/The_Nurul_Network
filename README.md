# The_Nurul_Network
Computational Research Project of Nurul Bin Ibrahim and Dr. Fitzgerald | Growth of Turbulent Jets | Neural Network

Engineered a deep learning-based neural network model utilizing Python and TensorFlow, specifically tailored to decode the intricate dynamics of stratified jets. This led to an uplift in prediction accuracy, rendering a better scientific understanding of physical oceanography and Earthâ€™s climatic systems.
Furthermore, the model significantly accelerated problem-solving speed in stochastic systems, enhancing computational efficiency, and paving the way for more accurate and timely analysis in ocean jet dynamics.
