# Runge-Kutta implementation of a system of second order ordinary differential equations

This folder contains the implementation of the Runge-Kutta integration of a two degree of freedom vibrations system as example for a second order ordinary differential equation. 

The python files and data folder can be described as follows:

- runge_kutta_example.py is a complete implementation of a Runge-Kutta integrator including model training and prediction 
- runge_kutta_save_training.py trains the trainable coefficients on the training data and saves the model weights
- runge_kutts_predict_only.py loads the saved model weights and predicts on test data
- model.py contains the RungeKuttaIntegratorCell class and the create_model function
- The data folder contains the input force, displacement and target displacement data.csv file for system identification as well as a seperate data02.csv file used for prediction only
- The data creation file runge_kutt_create_data.py is also included in the data folder and can be used to create additional data for model validation
